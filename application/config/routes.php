/**
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * URI Routing
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file lets you re-map URI requests to specific controller functions.
 *
 * Typically there is a one-to-one relationship between a URL string
 * and its corresponding controller class/method. The segments in a
 * URL normally follow this pattern:
 *
 *    example.com/class/method/id
 *
 * In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship
 * so that a different class/function is called than the one
 * corresponding to the URL.

/**
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Router Setup
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The RouteCollection object allows you to modify the way that the
 * Router works, by acting as a holder for it's configuration settings.
 * The following methods can be called on the object to modify
 * the default operations.
 *
 *    $routes->defaultNamespace()
 *
 * Modifies the namespace that is added to a controller if it doesn't
 * already have one. By default this is the global namespace (\).
 *
 *    $routes->defaultController()
 *
 * Changes the name of the class used as a controller when the route
 * points to a folder instead of a class.
 *
 *    $routes->defaultMethod()
 *
 * Assigns the method inside the controller that is ran when the
 * Router is unable to determine the appropriate method to run.
